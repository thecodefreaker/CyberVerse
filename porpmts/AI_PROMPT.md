# AI Assistant Prompt for Portfolio Website Development

## Project Context

I'm developing a dual-purpose website that serves as both my personal portfolio (Hardik Srivastava - Certified Ethical Hacker and Cybersecurity Innovator) and a comprehensive cybersecurity resource hub. The site showcases my professional expertise, projects, and contact information while providing valuable cybersecurity resources, tools, and educational content.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router (React 19)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theming
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for transitions and effects
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js for 3D elements
- **CMS**: Sanity for content management
- **Database**: Supabase for user data and dynamic content
- **Voice Interaction**: Web Speech API
- **AR Features**: AR.js for augmented reality experiences
- **Smooth Scrolling**: react-scroll
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js and react-chartjs-2

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Next.js App Router structure with additional organization for components, hooks, and utilities. Key directories include:

- `/src/app/`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `/src/components/`: UI components organized by purpose
- `/src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks for AR, analytics, etc.
- `/src/lib/`: Utility functions and service integrations
- `/src/schemas/`: Sanity CMS schemas

## What I Need Help With

I'm looking for assistance with [SPECIFIC TASK OR PROBLEM]. Feel free to suggest improvements, optimizations, or alternative approaches based on modern web development best practices. You can modify existing code or create new components as needed to achieve the best results.

When providing code solutions:

1. Use TypeScript with proper type definitions (avoid using `any` type)
2. Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
3. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS
4. Consider performance optimization and accessibility
5. Integrate with existing services (Sanity, Supabase, Sentry) where appropriate

## Special Considerations

1. **Cybersecurity Focus**: The site should reflect my expertise in cybersecurity with appropriate visual elements and content organization.

2. **Interactive Features**: Prioritize engaging user experiences with animations, 3D elements, and AR features where appropriate.

3. **Performance**: Ensure the site remains fast and responsive despite the rich interactive elements.

4. **Accessibility**: Maintain accessibility standards while implementing advanced features.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all features work well on mobile devices.
